    <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
    <p>There is a critical need to build over 1,000,000 units of inclusionary housing. Yet, current financing and development processes are inefficient, with less than 30% of loan requests successfully closing. This inefficiency leads to substantial delays and increased costs, leaving only a small fraction of the required housing stock developed.</p>
